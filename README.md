# Project: Data Science Analysis with Clustering, Rule Mining, and Ensemble Models

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was to explore and apply advanced data science techniques to real-world datasets, enhancing practical knowledge of clustering, association rule mining, and ensemble modeling. The goal was to uncover patterns and insights that can drive meaningful decisions.

## Why This Project Was Built
This project was built as an academic exercise to demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques. By analyzing three distinct datasets, the project aims to showcase the versatility of data science in solving diverse problems.

## Problem Statement
The project addresses the following problems:
- **Clustering**: How to group unlabeled data (Iris dataset) into meaningful clusters?
- **Association Rule Mining**: How to uncover patterns in customer purchase behavior (Online Retail dataset) to derive actionable business insights?
- **Ensemble Modeling**: How to improve classification accuracy (Titanic dataset) using ensemble methods compared to single models?

## Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, the following key lessons were learned:
- The importance of data normalization and feature scaling in clustering.
- Practical application of the elbow method for selecting the optimal number of clusters.
- Insights into customer behavior through rule mining with the Apriori algorithm.
- Enhanced understanding of ensemble techniques like Voting, Bagging, and Boosting for improving predictive performance.
- The value of comparing models to determine the most effective approach for a specific dataset.

## Unique Aspects
What makes this project stand out:
- Integration of three major data science methodologies (clustering, association rule mining, ensemble modeling) into a single cohesive analysis.
- Real-world applications derived from datasets spanning flowers, retail, and survival prediction.
- Comprehensive exploration and interpretation of results for actionable insights.

## Features
- **Clustering with K-means**: Optimal cluster determination and species mapping for the Iris dataset.
- **Association Rule Mining**: Discovery of high-confidence rules and their business implications for retail data.
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Comparison of ensemble and single models for Titanic survival prediction.
- **Visualizations**: Cluster visualizations, rule distributions, and model performance metrics.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of leveraging data science techniques to solve complex problems and derive valuable insights.
