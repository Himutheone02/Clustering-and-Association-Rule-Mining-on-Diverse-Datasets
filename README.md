# Clustering-and-Association-Rule-Mining-on-Diverse-Datasets
   This project applies K-means clustering to classify iris flowers, uses the Apriori algorithm to mine retail transaction patterns for business insights, and builds ensemble models to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. It integrates clustering, rule mining, and ensemble modeling to extract data-driven insights.
